At time 1 the seller would be able to pay off the option regardeless of the value of the stock a time 1, S_1, and still have the remaining $(1+r)*0.01 = 0.0125$ resulting from the money market investment. This is an arbitrage because the seller of the option needs no money initially and without risk of loss has 0.0125 at time 1. On the other hand if one could buy the option for less than the $X_0 =1.2$, say, for 1.19 then one should buy the option and set up the replicating portfolio in reverse. That is, we sell-short $\\Delta_0=1/2$ of the stock (we receive 2 dollars) at time 0 then with 1.19 buy the option, invest 0.8 in the money market and put the ramaining 0.01 in a separate money market. At time 1 if the stock goes up then the option pays 3 and the 0.8 is worth 1, thus with this 4 you are able to close the short position. On the contrary, if the stock goes down the option pays 0 and the 0.8 is at time 1 worth 1 dollar which is also the value you have to pay to close the short position. In either case you will end up with 0.0125 which is the 0.01 in the separate money market whose value at time 1 is $(1+r)0.01=0.0125$. Therefore there is again arbitrage."
